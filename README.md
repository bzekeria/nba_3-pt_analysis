<!---This is your group repo for your final project for COGS108.

This repository is private, and is only visible to the course instructors and your group mates; it is not visible to anyone else.

Template notebooks for each component are provided. Only work on the notebook prior to its due date. After each submission is due, move onto the next notebook (For example, after the proposal is due, start working in the Data Checkpoint notebook). 

This repository will be frozen on the final project due date. No further changes can be made after that time.

Your project proposal and final project will be graded based solely on the corresponding project notebooks in this repository.

Template Jupyter notebooks have been included, with your group number replacing the XXX in the following file names. For each due date, make sure you have a notebook present in this repository by each due date with the following name (where XXX is replaced by your group number):

- `ProjectProposal_groupXXX.ipynb`
- `DataCheckpoint_groupXXX.ipynb`
- `EDACheckpoint_groupXXX.ipynb`
- `FinalProject_groupXXX.ipynb`

This is *your* repo. You are free to manage the repo as you see fit, edit this README, add data files, add scripts, etc. So long as there are the four files above on due dates with the required information, the rest is up to you all. 

Also, you are free and encouraged to share this project after the course and to add it to your portfolio. Just be sure to fork it to your GitHub at the end of the quarter!-->

**The Weight of the 3-Pointer in the Modern NBA**

*[COGS 108- Data Science in Practice](https://github.com/COGS108) Fall 2022 Project*

Team Members: [Jackson Conte](https://github.com/jacksonconte), [Andrew Nguyen](https://github.com/3ndrew123/), [Anish Rajeshkumar] **add github link**, [Baraa Zekeria](https://github.com/bzekeria)


*For our project, we decided to explore whether or not the proportion of 3 point shots overall affected playoff success for NBA teams in the last 20 years. To do so, we pulled information from the NBA api from past games of every NBA Team and exploring trends for 2 point field goals and 3 point field goals. For our data analysis, we decided to quantify playoff success and separate our data set to perform on a Kendall-Tau Test on. In doing so, we could see if our hypothesis stands true for one era or multiple eras.*

    "With the rise of superstars like Stephen Curry, James Harden, and Kevin Durant in the past decade, the NBA has exploded in popularity, making it one of the most iconic sports leagues in the world. Between these 3 players, there exists one skill that they inhabit that has been proved pivotal in their scoring arsenal-- their 3 point shot. In the last 30 years, the game has evolved from focusing on midranged shots and shots from inside the paint, to having everybody chuck up a three every possession. As a result, teams are scrambling to adopt a team approach to the three point shot.\n",
    "\n",
    "An report by the NBA itself found that the average proportion of three point attempts amongst all shots taken has risen from around 20% to around 40%[^schuhmann]. Because the three pointer has revolutionized the game to evolve around skilled sharpshooters, many sports commentators have branded it as a *necessity* for a team's success.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2020, ESPN published a story with the bold headline: \"NBA playoff success has never been so dependent on 3s\". The stats used to justify this claim are the proportions of shots made and points scored off of 3s among playoff teams in the past 10 years[^goldsberry]. A 2018 article by ShotTracker is largely the same [^shea].\n",
    "\n",
    "James Dator of SB Nation goes so far as to propose rule suggestions for reducing the prevalence of the 3-pointer, claiming it would be better for the variety of basketball games and strategy. He goes into more depth than most, noting that while the volume of 3-point shots has gone up, their accuracy has remained roughly the same. In his words, \n",
    "\n",
    "> There is a clear issue that players are just getting too good. Everyone is learning to be a shooter, everyone is as successful as the snipers of the early 1990s. Part of that is due to defensive limitations to free up shooters, and part is simple evolution of the league. However, it order to keep the balance so basketball remains compelling it’s clear some changes will need to be made in order to reduce the incentive to shoot from three [^dator].\n",
    "\n",
    "He cites the example of the 2015-18 NBA Finals, where the 3-point-happy Warriors took on the more \"paint-dominating\" (2-point oriented) Cavaliers as an example of variety in basketball, while deriding the years following as more homogenized. This raises the question of whether or not the Cavs are an outlier, or if more traditional basketball strategies are still viable -- in other words, whether a high 3-point percentage is truly necessary for postseason success in the modern NBA (and if so, since when).\n",
    "\n",
    "What these articles establish is that both playoff teams and the league as a whole have shifted towards 3-point shots. What they do *not* establish is a *dependency*, contrary to ESPN's assertion. The aforementioned NBA article mentions the \"copycat\" effect, where a few successful teams implementing a new strategy will be followed by the rest of the league trying to emulate it[^schuhmann]. This could very well be an alternative explanation for the overall rise in 3s, and why we are interested to see if all teams, successful and unsuccessful, who have adopted the \"3-point revolution\" are genuinely better off than those who haven't.\n",

    "We predict that a higher 3-pt percentage will correlate with a better rate of playoff success. Due to the long-lasting success of the Golden State Warriors and other franchises in the playoff series, we believe that these team's three point heavy play style was a major contributor to their ability to perform well in the playoff rounds. Furthermore, we also believe that since this three point heavy playstyle is still relatively new in the NBA, teams have not fully figured out how to counter it,which also adds to the positive correlation between high three point percentage and playoff success and aids our hypothesis.\n"
